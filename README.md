## Overview
### Description
Tracks orders and packages once info is sent to the user's email. The app is able to display all incoming deliveries in one place, rather than have users check round different sites.

### App Evaluation
- **Category:** Delivery / Organizer
- **Mobile:** App is designed for mobile devices.
- **Story:** Reads data for tracking numbers of packages from users email, and stores the information, displaying delivery times, updates and location at the time. 
- **Market:** Could be of personal use to users, but very essential for small business owners, to have their orders arranged, and avoid confusion.
- **Habit:** The app could be used quite frequently, depending on how much the user expects deliveries.
- **Scope:** App would start out for just locating packages, could then be able to place orders and be a transaction site.
